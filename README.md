### Installation via NPM

```sh
npm i refactoringui/heroicons
```

### Usage

To use these icons, simply copy the source for the icon you need and inline it directly into your HTML:

```html
<svg
  class="h-6 w-6 text-gray-500"
  fill="none"
  viewBox="0 0 24 24"
  stroke="currentColor"
>
  <path
    stroke-linecap="round"
    stroke-linejoin="round"
    stroke-width="2"
    d="M12 8v4l3 3m6-3a9 9 0 11-18 0 9 9 0 0118 0z"
  />
</svg>
```

Both icon styles are preconfigured to be stylable by setting the `color` CSS property, either manually or using utility classes like `text-gray-500` in a framework like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
