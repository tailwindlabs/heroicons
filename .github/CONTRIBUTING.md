## Jokula Build Info

- Created a package namespace `jk`
- Icons go in `src/16/jk`, `src/20/jk`, `src/24/jk`
- Icons should be named by `<three letter code>-<icon name>`, eg. `isl-waterfall-skogafoss`
- These are the files involved, grep `jk` in them:
   package.json
   react/index.esm.js
   react/index.js
   react/package.json
   scripts/build.js
   scripts/verify-names.js
   vue/index.esm.js
   vue/index.js
   vue/package.json
   svgo.16.jk.mjs
   svgo.20.jk.mjs
   svgo.24.jk.mjs
- Adapted GitHub workflow to work with Jokula's GitHub and NPM
- At NPM, created an organization name `jokula-heroicons` for the scoped packages `@jokula-heroicons/react` and `@jokula-heroicons/vue`

1. Increment the version number in the `package.json`, `./react/package.json` and `./vue/package.json`
2. Publish the new release on GitHub. This will automatically trigger a GitHub action to publish these packages to NPM.
